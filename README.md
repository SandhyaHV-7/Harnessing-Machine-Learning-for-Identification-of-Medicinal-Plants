# Harnessing-Machine-Learning-for-Identification-of-Medicinal-Plants

The goal is likely to enhance the accuracy and performance of a model trained to recognize various medicinal plants from images or textual descriptions, using a dataset tailored for this specific domain.

This process might include:
1. Preprocessing data (images or text) specific to medicinal plants.
2. Selecting an appropriate base model for fine-tuning.
3. Setting up training configurations, possibly including custom labels and evaluation metrics.
4. Iteratively training and validating the model to optimize its performance.
